### *Operationalizing Research Through AI-Driven Capability Demonstrations*

This repository houses an interactive **AI Chief of Staff** and **Methodology Engine**. It is designed to bridge the gap between high-level academic research (Cybersecurity, Intelligence, and Historical Analysis) and practical, real-world application.

## 🎯 The Paradigm Shift
In an era of LLM-generated resumes, this project serves as a **Live Proof of Capability**. It allows hiring managers and technical leads to:
1.  **Interview my research:** Interact with a RAG-based AI trained on my 7 published books and DHS research papers.
2.  **Test my frameworks:** Use live tools that operationalize my findings on supply chain vulnerabilities and threat modeling.
3.  **Validate Methodology:** See how I translate complex historical network analysis into modern cybersecurity anomaly detection.

## 🛠️ Integrated Capabilities

### 1. The RAG "Knowledge Vault"
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) interface that serves as a proxy for my professional expertise. 
* **Corpus:** 7 Books, DHS research on Chinese Sleeper Malware, and sanitized Intelligence Analysis frameworks.
* **Safety Logic:** Programmed to protect sensitive operational history while demonstrating the underlying analytical rigor.

### 2. Supply Chain Risk Calculator
A live tool based on my specific DHS research findings. It calculates risk vectors for software and hardware vendors based on geopolitical data, component origin, and network criticality.

### 3. Influence Network Mapping
A demonstration of my historical research methodology (e.g., *Behind the Mask: Hitler the Socialite*) applied to modern data science. It shows how I identify hidden nodes and "sleeper" influencers in complex datasets.

## 💻 Technical Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.11+
* **Interface:** Streamlit (Cloud Deployment)
* **Orchestration:** LangChain (RAG Framework)
* **Vector Store:** FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
* **Intelligence:** GPT-4 (via OpenAI API)

## 🚀 How to Interact
1.  **Visit the Live App:** [(https://skdietrich.streamlit.app/)]
2.  **Input your specific problem:** Ask the AI, *"How would Dr. Stephen analyze a supply chain threat from a Tier 2 vendor?"*
3.  **Review the Code:** Explore `app.py` to see how I build systems that integrate data-driven research with large language models.
