# Strategic Infrastructure & CCIE Resilience
**Subject:** Cyber-Kinetic Cascades in Global Logistics  
**Correlation:** WarSim v5.6 and Maersk-Scale Degradation

## I. The Granular Failure: BGP/MPLS
Logistics failure is a Control Plane issue. When BGP Hijacking occurs, it isn't just a routing error; it is an identity theft of a Global Port Authority.
* **Granular Fix:** RPKI and BGP Prefix Independent Convergence (PIC). Reducing reconvergence to <1s prevents the ERP/WMS desync that causes a $2M/day loss.

## II. The Strategic Cascade: Purdue Model Level 0-2
Network failures at the corporate layer (Level 4) cascade to the physical layer (Level 0). In energy grids, loss of MPLS path protection breaks SCADA heartbeats.
* **WarSim v5.6 Link:** This mirrors 'Strategic Darkness,' which moves the Nuclear Escalation probability toward the 7.5% threshold.
