I've spent the last two decades working at the intersection of cybersecurity, intelligence, and systems architecture — first as a CIA contractor during Al-Qaeda and ISIS operations, then across private sector security consulting, and now as an independent researcher and author.

My PhD from Goethe University Frankfurt is in history, which sounds unrelated until you realize that threat analysis, attribution, and strategic modeling are fundamentally about reading patterns across complex systems. That background shapes how I approach everything from penetration testing to building AI pipelines.

On the technical side, I hold a CCIE and have built production systems ranging from LLM architectures and vector search pipelines to national-scale exercise simulations submitted to the Department of Defense. My current focus areas are supply chain vulnerability analysis (particularly Chinese sleeper malware in critical infrastructure), AI/ML system design, and data engineering.

I've published seven books covering true crime, historical analysis, and consciousness research. I also work as an independent security researcher focused on the hardware and firmware layers that most organizations overlook.
